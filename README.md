# open_discussions
This provides a discussion forum for use with other MIT applications.

## Installation specific to this app

This app uses a similar stack to other mitodl apps (Docker/Django/Webpack). Installation steps that are common to
all of these apps can be found below, beginning with the [Major Dependencies](#major-dependencies) section. **Those
installation steps should be completed before the following steps, which are specific to this app.**

 1. Set up a reddit instance for use as a backing store. See the README
 at https://github.com/mitodl/reddit-config for instructions on how
 to set up reddit to work with open_discussions.
 1. Run the containers for open_discussions and navigate to the running site in your browser
    ([outlined here](#5-run-the-container)).

## Major Dependencies
- Docker
  - OSX recommended install method: [Download from Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/mac/)
- docker-compose
  - Recommended install: pip (`pip install docker-compose`)
- Virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- _(OSX only)_ Node/NPM, and Yarn
  - OSX recommended install method: [Installer on Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - No specific version has been chosen yet.

## (OSX only) Getting your machine Docker-ready

#### Create your docker container:

The following commands create a Docker machine named ``opendiscussions``, start the
container, and configure environment variables to facilitate communication
with the edX instance.

    docker-machine create --driver virtualbox opendiscussions
    docker-machine start opendiscussions
    # 'docker-machine env (machine)' prints export commands for important environment variables
    eval "$(docker-machine env opendiscussions)"


## Docker Container Configuration and Start-up

#### 1) Create your ``.env`` file

This file should be copied from the example in the codebase:

    cp .env.example .env

All the  variables in the ``.env``` file should then be manually populated with values.

The default values for ``OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`` and ``OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_REDDIT_SECRET`` 
can be found in the reddit-config repo's Vagrantfile.

#### 2) _(OSX only)_ Set up and run the webpack dev server on your host machine

In the development environment, our static assets are served from the webpack
dev server. When this environment variable is set, the script sources will
look for the webpack server at that host instead of the host where Docker is running.

You'll need to install the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/)
package manager. You can do:

    sudo node ./scripts/install_yarn.js

To install it. Nice! You can check which version is installed in
`package.json` to be make you're getting the version we are
standardized on.

Now, in a separate terminal tab, use the webpack helper script to install npm modules and run the dev server:

    ./webpack_dev_server.sh --install

The ``--install`` flag is only needed if you're starting up for the first time, or if updates have been made
to the packages in ``./package.json``. If you've installed those packages and there are no ``./package.json``
updates, you can run this without the ``--install`` flag: ``./webpack_dev_server.sh``

**DEBUGGING NOTE:** If you see an error related to node-sass when you run this script, try running
``yarn install`` again.

#### 3) Build the containers
Run this command:

    docker-compose build

You will also need to run this command whenever ``requirements.txt`` or ``test_requirements.txt`` change.

#### 4) Create data structures
Create the database tables from the Django models:

    docker-compose run web ./manage.py migrate

#### 5) Run the container
Start Django, PostgreSQL, and other related services:

    docker-compose up

In another terminal tab, navigate to the open_discussions directory
and add a superuser in the now-running Docker container:

    docker-compose run web ./manage.py createsuperuser

You should now be able to do visit open_discussions in your browser on port `8063`. _(OSX Only)_ Docker auto-assigns
 the container IP. Run ``docker-machine ip`` to see it. Your open_discussions URL will
 be something like this: ``192.168.99.100:8063``.

#### 5a) Log in

There is no official login page yet, so in order to use the site as a logged in user, you'll need to login
via Django admin first (`http://<open_discussions_url>:8063/admin`). Use the credentials for the superuser you created
in the step above.

#### 5b) Set up initial channel/post data

The app UI is not currently usable until a channel exists and the logged-in user has a post associated with the channel.
The following commands will create a channel and a post:

First, create an authentication token (good for one hour) in a django shell.
 ```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework_jwt.settings import api_settings
user = User.objects.get(username=<superuser username>)
jwt_payload_handler = api_settings.JWT_PAYLOAD_HANDLER
jwt_encode_handler = api_settings.JWT_ENCODE_HANDLER
payload = jwt_payload_handler(user)
payload['roles'] = ['staff']
token = jwt_encode_handler(payload)
print(token)
```

Then use these bash commands with the above token to create a channel and post:
 ```bash
 TOKEN=<token>
 # Create a channel
 curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://<open_discussions_url>:8063/api/v0/channels/" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"title": "Test Channel", "name": "test_channel", "public_description": "This is a test channel", "channel_type": "public"}'

 # Create a post for the channel
 curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://<open_discussions_url>:8063/api/v0/channels/test_channel/posts/" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"text": "This is a text post in the test channel", "title": "Test Post", "channel_name": "test_channel"}'
 ```


## Running Commands and Testing

As shown above, manage commands can be executed on the Docker-contained
open_discussions app. For example, you can run a Python shell with the following command:

    docker-compose run web ./manage.py shell

Tests should be run in the Docker container, not the host machine. They can be run with the following commands:

    # Run the full suite
    ./test_suite.sh
    # Run Python tests only
    docker-compose run web tox
    # Single file test
    docker-compose run web tox /path/to/test.py
    # Run the JS tests with coverage report
    docker-compose run watch npm run-script coverage
    # run the JS tests without coverage report
    docker-compose run watch npm test
    # run a single JS test file
    docker-compose run watch npm test /path/to/test.js
    # Run the JS linter
    docker-compose run watch npm run-script lint
    # Run JS type-checking
    docker-compose run watch npm run-script flow
    # Run SCSS linter
    docker-compose run watch npm run scss_lint

Note that running [`flow`](https://flowtype.org) may not work properly if your
host machine isn't running Linux. If you are using a Mac, you'll need to run
`flow` on your host machine, like this:

    yarn install --frozen-lockfile
    npm run-script flow


#### 6) Integration with MicroMasters

MicroMasters and Open-Discussions share a cookie, which means that they need to be running on the same domain.
This can be emulated by modifying your hosts file, for example:

 ```
192.168.99.100  micromasters.odl.local
192.168.99.101  od.odl.local
 ```

The following variable should also be set in your MicroMasters ``.env`` file:

  - ``OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_JWT_SECRET``: same value as in the open-discussions ``.env`` file
  - ``OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_COOKIE_NAME``: same value as in the open-discussions ``.env`` file
  - ``OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_COOKIE_DOMAIN``: the root domain, for example ``odl.local``
  - ``OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_REDIRECT_URL``: the domain-based URL for open-discussions, 
    for example ``http://od.odl.local:8063/``
  - ``OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_BASE_URL``: the base internal URL for open-discussions, 
    i.e. ``http://192.168.99.101:8063`` or ``http://localhost:8063/``
  - ``FEATURE_OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_POST_UI=True``
  - ``FEATURE_OPEN_DISCUSSIONS_CREATE_CHANNEL_UI=True``

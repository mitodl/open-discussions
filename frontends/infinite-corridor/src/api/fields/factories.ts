   * The URLs that `casual` makes contain capital letters in their hostnames.
   * But hostnames are case-insensitive, so browsers and JSDOM both standardize
   * the hostname portion of URLs on HTML elements to be lowercase, e.g.,
   *
   * src code contains:       `<img src="http://WOOF.com/DOG.png" />`
   * browser renders:         `<img src="http://woof.com/DOG.png" />`
   *
   *
   * This makes testing with hostnames containing capitals annoying.
   * So let's standardize the hostnames here like a browser would.

===================

DevOps testing course containing front-end tests.

Testers may use this course for their testing activities, such as:

1. installing/uninstalling on the staging servers
2. modifying the course, though try not to delete sections of the course and save those to github

There is a version of this course safe in another repo so you shouldn't be able to do serious damage.
